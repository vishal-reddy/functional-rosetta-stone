This project consist of basic applied examples of functional programming in the JVM with simple examples in basic math. As long as you understand addition / subtraction / multiplication / division and the modulo operator, the rest of the concepts are in the paradigm.
This project is primarily executed with unit tests. Each file should have it's corresponding Unit test in the repo.
You can run all tests with `./gradlew test`
There is also an `nrepl` gradle task which will spawn off a clojure repl that can be connected to.
